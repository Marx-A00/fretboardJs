# Guitar Theory Learning Tool

This project aims to create an interactive web application for learning music theory, guitar scales, and eventually provide real-time audio feedback through an audio interface.

## Overview

The Guitar Theory Learning Tool helps guitarists visualize and understand music theory concepts, particularly scales and their patterns on the fretboard. The application provides an intuitive interface for exploring different scales, modes, and musical concepts.

## Features

- Interactive guitar fretboard visualization
- Scale and mode exploration
- Music theory concepts explained visually
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile use

## Planned Features

- Audio playback of notes and scales
- Real-time audio input from guitar through audio interface
- Note detection and visualization
- Practice modes and exercises
- Chord library and progressions

## Technical Implementation

The project currently uses:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Live-server for local development
