- Want to be able to take input from real guitar and show on fretboard which notes are being played
## Development Roadmap

1. Create basic fretboard visualization
2. Implement scale pattern display
3. Add music theory educational content
4. Integrate Web Audio API for sound generation
5. Implement audio input capabilities using Web Audio API

## Audio Interface Integration

Yes, it's definitely possible to connect a guitar to the application using the Web Audio API! Here's how it could work:

1. Connect your guitar to an audio interface
2. The interface connects to your computer via USB
3. The Web Audio API can access this input stream
4. JavaScript code can analyze the incoming audio to detect notes
5. The application can then visualize what you're playing in real-time

This would require:
- Web Audio API implementation
- Audio analysis algorithms for pitch detection
- Low-latency processing to ensure responsive feedback
